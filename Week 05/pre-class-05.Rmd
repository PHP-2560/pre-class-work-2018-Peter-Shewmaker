Standardizing a variable means subtracting the mean, and then dividing by the standard deviation. Let’s use a loop to standardize the numeric columns in the [Western Collaborative Group Study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00005174). This study began in 1960 with 3154 men ages 39-59, who were employed in one of 11 California based companies. They were followed until 1969 during this time, 257 of these men developed coronary heart disease (CHD). You can read this data in with the code below. You can access this dataset with the following code:

```{R}

suppressMessages(library(foreign))
wcgs <- read.dta("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B8CsRLdwqzbzYWxfN3ExQllBQkU")
```

The data has the following variables:

### Question 1: Standardize Function

A. Create a function called standardize.me() that takes a numeric vector as an argument, and returns the standardized version of the vector.
```{r}
#The standardize.me function takes each element of a numeric vector x, subtracts the mean of x from it and then divides by the standard deviation of x. This creates a standardized version of the vector x.
standardize.me <- function(x){
  standardized <- (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
  standardized
}
```
B. Assign all the numeric columns of the original WCGS dataset to a new dataset called WCGS.new.
```{r}
#Using the dplyr function "select_if", the columns of the original dataset that are numeric are assigned to a new dataset WCGS.new.
library(dplyr)
WCGS.new <- select_if(wcgs, is.numeric)

```
C. Using a loop and your new function, standardize all the variables WCGS.new dataset.
```{r}
#This loop standardizes each column of the new dataset containing only numeric columns.
for(i in seq_along(WCGS.new)){
  WCGS.new[,i] <- standardize.me(WCGS.new[,i])
}
#Notice that since the "chol" column contains an NA value, the whole column becomes NA when the standardize function is applied to it, since the mean is not calculated with NA values. The function could be fixed to deal with the cases of NA value - since this is not explicitly asked for, I'll leave it out.
```
D. What should the mean and standard deviation of all your new standardized variables be? Test your prediction by running a loop
```{r}
#After being standardized, the mean should be 0 and the standard deviation should be 1 for each of the standardized variables. Let's check this:
means <- numeric(0)
sds <- numeric(0)
for(i in seq_along(WCGS.new)){
  means[i] <- mean(WCGS.new[,i])
  sds[i] <- sd(WCGS.new[,i])
}
means
sds
#In fact, excluding the NA values, the mean is extremely close to 0 for each of the standardized variables, and the standard deviations are all exactly 1.
```



### Question 2: Looping to Calculate

A. Using a loop, calculate the mean weight of the subjects separated by the type of CHD they have.
```{r}
#First we initiate vectors that will contain the number of people with each type of CHD, and then the sum of their weights. Then these two vectors can be divided to produce the mean weight of the subjects by the type of CHD they have.
num_type <- numeric(4)
names(num_type) <- c("no CHD", "MI or SD", "silent MI", "angina")
sum_weight <- numeric(4)
names(sum_weight) <- c("no CHD", "MI or SD", "silent MI", "angina")
#This for loop looks at each row, determines the type of CHD the patient has, and adds 1 to the number of people with that type of CHD, then adds the weight of the patient to the sum of the weights of the patients with that type of CHD.
for(i in 1:nrow(wcgs)){
  if(wcgs$typchd69[i] == "no CHD"){
    num_type[1] <- num_type[1] + 1
    sum_weight[1] <- sum_weight[1] + wcgs$weight[i]
  }
  else if(wcgs$typchd69[i] == "MI or SD"){
    num_type[2] <- num_type[2] + 1
    sum_weight[2] <- sum_weight[2] + wcgs$weight[i]
  }
  else if(wcgs$typchd69[i] == "silent MI"){
    num_type[3] <- num_type[3] + 1
    sum_weight[3] <- sum_weight[3] + wcgs$weight[i]
  }
  else if(wcgs$typchd69[i] == "angina"){
    num_type[4] <- num_type[4] + 1
    sum_weight[4] <- sum_weight[4] + wcgs$weight[i]
  }
}
#Once the loop is finished, the sum of the weights is divided by the number of people with each type of CHD, giving the mean weight of the subjects separated by the type of CHD they have.
mean_by_type <- sum_weight/num_type
names(mean_by_type) <- c("no CHD", "MI or SD", "silent MI", "angina")
mean_by_type
```
B. Now do the same thing, but now don’t use a loop
```{r}
#Now, using dplyr functions and piping, we group by the type of CHD and summarise by the mean weight.
wcgs %>% 
  group_by(typchd69) %>%
    summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```
